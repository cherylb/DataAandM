Project 5 
========================================================
Data Source:  R datasets package, using the eurodist data
Procedure:
1.  Load libraries for datasets, dplyr, stats, reshape2, and RNeo4j 
2.  import eurodist object
3.  use stats and reshape2 to read and reshape the eurodist 'dist' object into a data frame
4.  create a unique list of cities from the data, these will be the nodes
5.  remove duplicates from the distance data
6.  use RNeo4j package to connect to default graph
7.  loop through the cities to create a node for each
8.  loop through the distance data frame, create a relationship with the property of 'km' set to the distance, if one does not already exist


```{r}
library(datasets)
library(dplyr)
library(stats)
library(reshape2)
library(RNeo4j)  # devtools::install_github("nicolewhite/RNeo4j")


df <- data.frame(melt(as.matrix(eurodist), varnames = c("City1", "City2")))

#list of cities (nodes)
cities <- df %>%select(City1) %>% group_by(City1)%>% summarise(count = n())

# remove duplicates get distances (relationships)
distance <- unique(df %>%filter(value != 0))

graph = startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data/")
graph$version
clear(graph)

#import cities as nodes into Neo4j
n <- nrow(cities)
for (i in 1:n){
  createNode(graph, "City", name = cities[i,1], continent = "Europe")
}


# create relationships
n <- nrow(distance)
for (i in 1:n){
  c1 <- distance[i,1]
  c2 <- distance[i,2]
  d <- distance[i,3]
  # get c1 node
  qry1 <- "MATCH(:City {name:{x1}})-[r:Distance]-(:City {name:{x2}})
         RETURN r"
  r1 <- NULL
  r1 <- getSingleRel(graph,qry1,x1 = c2, x2 = c1)
  
  if(is.null(r1)){
    
    qry2 <- "MATCH (c:City) WHERE c.name = {x} RETURN c"
    n1 <- getNodes(graph,qry2, x = c1)
    n2 <- getNodes(graph,qry2, x = c2)
    createRel(n1[[1]], "Distance", n2[[1]], km = d)
  }
  
}
```

The resulting graph shows all of the cities with a relationship between all of them. 

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
![Graph](C:\Users\Cheryl\Desktop\Graph.png)
```
A query to find distance between Athens and Brussels returns the km property

```{r}

# Query the results
# find the distance between Brussels and Athens
c1 = "Brussels"
c2 = "Athens"
r <- getSingleRel(graph,qry1,x2 = c1, x1 = c2)

print("Distance: ")
print(r[1])

```
This graph database looks very interesting when displayed, but is not very efficient and provides limited information.  It would be a better representation if we had a way to show the distance varies visually rather than just a property of the relationship, and for that a phyiscal map is probably the best.  If the intent was to provide more details about each route, adding additional properties to the relationships might make this a useful exercise, but with this limited data there is not a clear advantage over a more conventional relational model.
